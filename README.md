## First Contribution Repository
Welcome to the First Contribution Repository! This repository is designed to help new contributors make their first open-source contribution. Follow the steps below to add your program to this repository.

## What is a Repository?
A repository (or "repo") is a storage space where your project's files and revision history are kept. It's a central place where all the code, issues, pull requests, and documentation for your project can be managed.

##Why Git and GitHub are Important?
Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in your codebase over time. It enables collaboration among developers by managing and merging code changes efficiently.

GitHub is a platform built on top of Git that provides additional features like hosting repositories, managing project workflows, and facilitating collaboration through pull requests and issues.
